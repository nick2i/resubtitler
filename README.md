# resubtitler (WIP)

`resubtitler` is a (WIP) utility tool to rename subtitle files in bulk. It's intended for scenarios where subtitle files follow a different naming format compared to their corresponding media files.

When the subtitle and media files follow the same naming scheme, they can be automatically detected by applications like VLC media player.

# How to use

(TODO - also add a picture or two)

# Roadmap

I'd like to support re-timing subtitles eventually as well (e.g. adjust every subtitle so it appears .5 seconds later). Probably just .srt files to start, maybe expanding to a couple other common formats.
